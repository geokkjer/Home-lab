#+DESCRIPTION: Configuration details for the limiting-factor machine, which is set to become a file server

* Machine Overview

*Machine Name:* limiting-factor
*Culture Reference:* LimitingFactor (GSV) - A machine that defines boundaries or bottlenecks
*Role:* File Server (Future)
*Current Status:* Minimal configuration, preparation phase

* Hardware Specifications

- *CPU:* Intel N150 (low-power processor)
- *RAM:* 12 GB
- *Storage:* Six NVMe slots available for future storage expansion
- *Filesystem:* ext4 (for simplicity and reliability)

* Configuration Details

** Users
- *Primary User:* sma (Diziet Sma - System Administrator)
- *UID:* 1001 (consistent across machines)
- *Groups:* wheel, networkmanager, and other admin groups

** Current Setup
- Minimal NixOS configuration
- SSH access enabled
- No specialized services yet (will be added when transitioning to file server role)

** Future Plans
- Configure as dedicated file server
- Set up NFS/SMB shares
- Implement storage management across NVMe slots
- Add backup and redundancy solutions

* Network Configuration

- *Hostname:* limiting-factor
- *Network:* NetworkManager enabled
- *SSH:* Enabled for remote administration

* Security

- SSH key-based authentication
- Standard firewall configuration
- Admin user with sudo access

* Notes

This machine is currently set up with a minimal configuration to prepare for its future role as a file server. The name "limiting-factor" is fitting as it will potentially define storage boundaries and could become a bottleneck if the storage needs exceed its capabilities.

The configuration follows the lab's standard patterns and can be easily extended when the machine is ready to take on its file server responsibilities.
