## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Privacy & Anonymity

#### Current Architecture (Tailscale + Internal Proxy)

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Complete traffic isolation within home network
- ✅ No external VPN provider sees your search traffic
- ✅ Search engines see your reverse proxy's IP, not client IP
- ✅ Tailscale encrypted mesh network for client access
- ✅ Zero-log proxy configuration possible

**Limitations:**

- ⚠️ Depends on Tailscale service availability
- ⚠️ Tailscale company could theoretically see connection metadata

#### Alternative Architecture (WireGuard + Exit Node)

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Complete control over VPN infrastructure
- ✅ No third-party VPN service dependencies
- ✅ Search engines see Tailscale exit node IP
- ✅ Full traffic encryption with WireGuard
- ✅ Open-source VPN solution

**Limitations:**

- ⚠️ Search traffic still routes through Tailscale infrastructure
- ⚠️ More complex key management and client configuration

### 2. Security

#### Current Architecture

**Strengths:**

- 🔒 Tailscale's battle-tested security (WireGuard-based)
- 🔒 Network access controlled by Tailscale ACLs

Client → WireGuard → Home Lab → Tailscale Exit → Internet
(2 encryption layers, suboptimal routing)
```

### 5. Reliability & Availability

#### Current Architecture

**Availability Factors:**

- ✅ Tailscale has 99.9%+ uptime
- ✅ Redundant Tailscale infrastructure
